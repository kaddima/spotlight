# Cursor Rules for Vehicle Dashboard

## UI Components
- Prefer shadcn components over custom ones
- Use Lucide React icons exclusively
- Always use appropriate color variables from the theme
- Prefer small, composable components over large monolithic ones

## TypeScript
- Always type React components with explicit interfaces
- Never use 'any' unless absolutely necessary
- Use type instead of interface for simple type definitions
- Ensure convex functions have proper type definitions

## Code Style
- Use // for single-line comments
- Keep functions under 50 lines where possible
- Limit nesting to 3 levels
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## React Patterns
- Use Next.js Image component instead of HTML img tags
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled ones
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Extract reusable hooks for shared logic

## Import Order
1. React and Next.js imports
2. External libraries and dependencies
3. Convex-specific imports
4. Internal components and utilities
5. Type imports
6. CSS/style imports

## Convex Best Practices
- Group related mutations and queries in the same file
- Add descriptive comments for complex database operations
- Validate all inputs with proper validators
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate messages
